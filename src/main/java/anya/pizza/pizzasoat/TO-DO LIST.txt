PLATINUM:
1. Make it rarer
2. Make copper crushable to make platinum. Maybe make a system to drop other stuff and platinum to be rarer or have it crushed
to platinum nuggets that can be made into platinum ingots.
3. Make the Ore crushable into Native Platinum and then smelt Native Platinum into Platinum ingots.
4. Figure out an armor effect for the armor

SULFER:
1. Redo block texture.

Create achievements for getting the armor sets.

Maybe add more tags.

Look into carbine and maybe add it. If so make a drill bit from it.
Look into cobalt and maybe add it. If so make a drill bit from it.
